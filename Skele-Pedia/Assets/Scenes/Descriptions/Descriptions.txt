Sternum
Description: The T-shaped bone that connects to your ribs and helps protect your heart from harm!
You can try placing your knuckles against the middle of your chest. 
Did you get a funny feeling?
That's your sternum!
Wow!

Fibula:

The Fibula is located behind the knee and goes all the way down the lower half of the leg! The fibula is smaller and thiner than the tibia.  Unlike the Tibia, it is not a weight bearing bone. Helps us to stay balanced when we walk so that we don't fall!
Provides stability to ankle

C1 Vertebra
The vertebrae at the top of the neck tend to be smaller and more mobile.
These vertebrae protect the spinal cord and joints. They provide a support, structure, and flexibility to the neck.
They are capable of supporting back and forth motion (rocking).

Ribs:
All those narrow little curved bones above your stomache? 
Those are ribs! 
Each rib is unique and differently shaped. In total there is 12. 
The ribs help to protect the internal organs that they enclose and lend support to the trunk.

Spine: 
Your spine is so important! 
It helps you sit, stand, twist and walk about!
It connects all the different parts of your body together!
Without your spine, you would surely not be able to move!

Scapula, 
Scap - yoo - la!
also called shoulder blade, either of two large bones on the back of of the shoulder.
Because they have this flat surface, they kind of look like triangles! 
The scapula helps you move your shoulders about in every way when it connects to your muscles!

Tibia,
The Tibia! Aka the shinbone, is the larger of the two bones that make up the lower leg. The Tibia connects to your knee at the top and it can move up and down!

Foot:
Feet! A very important bone! Without feet, you would surely not be able to walk! 
Feet help support movement of your body by providing a flat surface.
They can move up and down and side to side. Just not too much! 
Your feet are less mobile than your hands, but that doesn't mean your feet aren't just as imporant!

Humerus
The big bone of your arm! Don't be fooled by the name! The Humerus's job is no laughing matter.
The Humerus connects your forearm (smaller and farther down), to your shoulders!
Because its connected to your shoulders (or Scapula), it can move way more than your forearm bones (Radius and Ulna), can!

C2 Verteba

The 2nd Vertebrae in the Spine. It can handle greater loads from the neck than your C1 Vertebra can!

A carpal bone is any of the several small angular bones that make up the wrist in humans (carpus). They correspond to the rear or lower limb's tarsal bones. The scaphoid, lunate, triangular, and pisiform bones are in the row toward the forearm. The hand's metacarpal bones are firmly attached to the distal row. The wrist joint is formed by the proximal row articulating with the radius (of the forearm) and the articular disk (a fibrous structure between the carpals and the malleolus of the ulna).

clavicle, also called collarbone, acts as a sort of girdle in humans that connects the arms to the body as well as the shoulder blades and spine; it struts out to support weight on the shoulder.

ulna, inner of two bones of the forearm when viewed with the palm facing forward. (The other, shorter bone of the forearm is the radius.) The upper end of the ulna presents a large C-shaped notch—the semilunar, or trochlear, notch—which articulates with the trochlea of the humerus (upper arm bone) to form the elbow joint.

skull, skeletal framework of the head of vertebrates, composed of bones or cartilage, which form a unit that protects the brain and some sense organs. The upper jaw, but not the lower, is part of the skull. The human cranium, the part that contains the brain, is globular and relatively large in comparison with the face. In humans the skull is supported by the highest vertebra, called the atlas, allowing for nodding motion.
